# Swift

If you upgrade to cocoapods 0.36, you can import the Swift version of PromiseKit with:

{% highlight ruby %}
pod 'PromiseKit/Swift'
{% endhighlight %}

However the current version (0.35) does not have good Swift support. To use PromiseKit in your Swift project:

1. Add all of the `swift` directory to your sources and in your `xcodeproj` drag and drop `PromiseKit.xcodeproj` into your sources.
2. Add PromiseKit.framework to the "Embedded Binaries" section in your Project’s main-target’s “General” settings.

# Swift Documentation

Currently the Swift version is undocumented. The Swift version is “complete” but I am waiting on newer versions of Xcode before I commit entirely to its API, so I still consider it a work-in-progress.

The xcodeproj itself contains an example Swift app with promises.

## Using objc PromiseKit in Swift Projects

It seems that you cannot use Objective C promises in Swift projects. At least I cannot make this compile:

{% highlight swift %}
let promise = PMKPromise(value: true)
let then = promise.then() as (AnyObject) -> PMKPromise!
then({ (Bool)->Void in
    // won't compile
})
{% endhighlight %}

I think there is some detail in that Objective-C blocks are not exactly the same as Swift closures. And since the API for PMKPromise does not explicitly define the parameter for `then`, it will not convert.

Even if you could do this, it would be pretty ugly due to Objective C PromiseKit returning a block that takes a block to facilitate the dot-notation.
